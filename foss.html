    <h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>License:</strong> Must have a valid <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">Free and Open Source
                license</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> A well written README and video demo are important. These will determine the
            first round of elimination. Before your code is reviewed, the quality of your README will be. Please be
            concise in explaining what your project does, how to install it, test it, and use it. Similarly, write
            concise and meaningful commit messages that show the progression of the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Applications must be complete and working.</li>
        <li><strong>Design and aesthetics:</strong> If you are making a user interface, try and ensure that they are
            clean, modern, and usable.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeframe:</strong> The project must be reasonably built within the given timeframe. The judgement
            of the jury will be final in this.</li>
        <li><strong>Credits:</strong> If you are using existing code, make sure you credit it. Plagiarism, which is all
            too common unfortunately, is strictly not appreciated.</li>
        <li><strong>Demo Video:</strong> Participants must submit a video demo before the clock ends (uploaded on
            YouTube or any other platform that is accessible to us). Restricted to 3 mins.</li>
